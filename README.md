# [WIP]⁙Quincunx⁙

A lightweight orchestration core for real-time incremental generation, with parametric curve modulation and pluggable calculate backends.

Quincunx is originally designed to be embedded inside larger systems such as vocal editors (OpenUTAU-like) or live singing engines. It acts as the bridge between abstract musical data (Notes, Phonemes, Curves) and the concrete execution graph managed by [Orchid](https://hex.pm/packages/orchid).

## Features

- Real-time Incremental Rendering
- Parametric Curve Modulation
- Session State Management

## Define Scope

Quincunx is:

* An orchestration core for application
* Backend-agnostic (Python / ONNX / HTTP service)
* Designed for fine-grained modulation
* Embeddable inside BEAM systems

And Quincunx isn't:

* A singing synthesizer editor
* A DAW
* A GUI framework
* A training toolkit
* An acoustic model implementation
